Singapore HDB Resale Flat Prices for 1990 - 2022
================

## Introduction

As a millenial growing up in Singapore and starting out in my first job,
one of my life’s goals is to own a house on this little red dot with my
life partner (*read: wife*).

Here in [Singapore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore), there are
generally [two
ways](https://www.propertyguru.com.sg/property-guides/the-different-types-of-housing-in-singapore-9916)
to do this:

-   [Public
    Housing](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/about-us/our-role/public-housing-a-singapore-icon)
    -   Brand new Built-to-Order (BTO) Flats
    -   Resale Flats
-   Private Housing (e.g., condominiums, landed property, etc.)

Whilst BTOs tend to be the choice of most young Singaporean couples, my
current and potential future situation may push my partner and I to look
towards resale flats to meet our housing needs. As such, I set forth on
this project that will focus on resale flats under the Housing &
Development Board (HDB).

This project therefore seeks to analyse the prices of Singapore’s HDB
Resale Flats for the years of 1990 - 2022. Data was obtained from
[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/syrahmadi/resale-hdb-flat-prices-2000-2022),
which was sourced from GovTech’s open data portal,
[data.gov.sg](https://data.gov.sg/dataset/resale-flat-prices).
